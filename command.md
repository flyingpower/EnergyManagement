The files in this repo, esp. 

/dashboards
/packages
configuration.yaml

are an energy management system for Home Assistant running on Raspberry Pi.
The overview is described in README.md.
You can access the installation via /Volumes/config/ directly.
Make sure that you keep the files in the repo in sync but you can make all changes directly in the installation.
The Dashboard can be accessed via  /Volumes/config/.storage/lovelace.energie_management and changed directly.
Try to understand first what the logic of the system is and how the automations work, before we fix bugs.
